This repository contains two reports focused on the electrical characterization of MOSFET devices.
The first report investigates the output resistance by sweeping the drain voltage at different gate biases, highlighting its dependence on channel length and width.
The second report analyzes the subthreshold slope (STS) and the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) effect, comparing long-channel and short-channel transistors.
